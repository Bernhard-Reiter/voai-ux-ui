# Vercel Deployment Configuration for DSGVO-compliant Hosting

## Summary
This PR configures the voai-website for deployment on Vercel with DSGVO-compliant hosting in the EU region.

## Changes Made

### üåç Infrastructure
- Updated `vercel.json` to use Frankfurt region (`fra1`) for DSGVO compliance
- Configured build and deployment settings for the monorepo structure

### üîê Environment Variables
- Added `ENCRYPTION_KEY` for all environments
- Configured `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` for production/preview/development
- All Supabase credentials and other environment variables are properly set

### üêõ CI/CD Fixes
- Fixed TypeScript configuration in `tailwind.config.ts` to resolve type-check errors
- Resolved linting errors that would cause CI failures

### üìö Documentation
- Added `VERCEL_ENV_SETUP.md` with detailed environment setup instructions
- Created `scripts/setup-vercel-env.sh` for automated environment configuration
- Added deployment status documentation

## Deployment Status
- ‚úÖ Preview deployment successful: https://voai-website-ck2qphf7c-vi4.vercel.app
- ‚úÖ Build successful (28 pages generated)
- ‚úÖ All environment variables configured
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Preview shows 401 due to Vercel SSO (normal for team accounts)

## Test Plan
- [x] Local development environment works
- [x] Build completes successfully
- [x] Type-check passes
- [x] Linting passes (warnings only, no errors)
- [x] Preview deployment successful
- [ ] Production deployment (after merge)
- [ ] Security headers verification
- [ ] DSGVO compliance check

## Next Steps
After merging this PR:
1. Production deployment will trigger automatically
2. Verify security headers at https://securityheaders.com
3. Run DSGVO compliance checks
4. Set up monitoring and alerts

## Notes
- The 401 error on preview URLs is expected due to Vercel SSO protection
- Some test failures exist but are not blocking for deployment
- All critical CI checks should pass
