-- SECURITY BEST PRACTICES IMPLEMENTED:
-- ============================================
-- 1. All tables have RLS enabled
-- 2. All policies use auth.uid() for user identification
-- 3. Service role has separate policies for backend operations
-- 4. File uploads are restricted to user-specific folders
-- 5. Cascading deletes on user deletion
-- 6. Proper indexes for performance
-- 7. Updated_at triggers for audit trails

-- To verify RLS is working correctly, run these queries:
-- SELECT tablename, rowsecurity 
-- FROM pg_tables 
-- WHERE schemaname = 'public';

-- To list all policies:
-- SELECT schemaname, tablename, policyname, permissive, roles, cmd, qual, with_check
-- FROM pg_policies
-- WHERE schemaname = 'public'
-- ORDER BY tablename, policyname;
