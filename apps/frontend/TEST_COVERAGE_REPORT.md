# Test Coverage Report

## Summary

This report summarizes the comprehensive tests implemented for critical components of the VOAI Frontend application.

## Tests Created

### 1. Upload API Utilities Tests (`__tests__/api/upload-utilities.test.ts`)

- **Total Tests**: 17
- **Coverage**: Comprehensive testing of upload-related utilities
- **Key Features Tested**:
  - Filename sanitization (special characters, path traversal, length limits)
  - Rate limiting functionality
  - Virus scanning simulation
  - File type validation
  - File size validation
  - Security measures (unique IDs, secure paths)
  - CORS headers

### 2. Dashboard Page Tests (`__tests__/app/dashboard/page.test.tsx`)

- **Total Tests**: 10
- **Coverage**: 100% for dashboard page component
- **Key Features Tested**:
  - Authentication redirect when not logged in
  - Loading states
  - Dashboard content display
  - Workflow panel placeholder
  - Quick stats cards
  - Error handling
  - CSS layout verification
  - User data handling

### 3. GDPR Utilities Tests (`__tests__/lib/gdpr.test.ts`)

- **Total Tests**: 16
- **Coverage**: 94% statement coverage
- **Key Features Tested**:
  - Analytics consent checking
  - Marketing consent checking
  - Analytics initialization
  - Marketing tools initialization
  - Consent status retrieval
  - Non-essential cookie clearing
  - Consent persistence
  - Error handling for invalid data

### 4. Config Module Tests (`__tests__/lib/config.test.ts`)

- **Total Tests**: 33
- **Coverage**: 100% statement coverage
- **Key Features Tested**:
  - Environment variable handling
  - Required vs optional environment variables
  - Default values
  - Production vs development behavior
  - Config structure validation
  - File type mappings
  - Numeric parsing
  - Environment detection
  - Edge cases (empty strings, invalid values)

## Test Patterns Used

1. **Unit Testing**: All tests focus on isolated functionality
2. **Mocking**: Proper mocking of external dependencies (Next.js, Supabase, filesystem)
3. **Error Handling**: Tests for both success and failure scenarios
4. **Edge Cases**: Comprehensive testing of boundary conditions
5. **Type Safety**: Tests ensure proper TypeScript types are maintained

## Coverage Metrics

### Critical Components Coverage:

- `lib/config.ts`: 100% coverage
- `lib/gdpr.ts`: 94% coverage
- `app/(dashboard)/dashboard/page.tsx`: 100% coverage
- Upload utilities: Comprehensive testing through utility functions

### Overall Impact:

- Increased test count from ~26 to 102 tests
- Improved confidence in critical system components
- Established patterns for future test development

## Recommendations

1. **Upload Route Testing**: Consider integration tests for the actual upload route once the Next.js server component testing issues are resolved
2. **E2E Testing**: Add Playwright tests for critical user flows
3. **Performance Testing**: Add tests for rate limiting under load
4. **Security Testing**: Consider adding penetration testing for upload functionality

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests with coverage
npm test -- --coverage

# Run specific test files
npm test -- __tests__/lib/config.test.ts

# Run tests in watch mode
npm test -- --watch
```

## Maintenance

- Tests should be updated whenever the corresponding components change
- New features should include tests following the established patterns
- Regular coverage reports should be generated to ensure coverage doesn't regress
