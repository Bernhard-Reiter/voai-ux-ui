# VOAI Website Deployment Summary

## Status: Build Fixed, Deployment Configuration Issue

### What We've Successfully Fixed:

1. **CSS Build Issues** ✅
   - Moved `tailwindcss`, `postcss`, and `autoprefixer` to production dependencies
   - Converted Tailwind preset from ESM to CommonJS format
   - Fixed module resolution issues

2. **TypeScript Build Issues** ✅
   - Moved `typescript` and type definitions to production dependencies
   - Fixed implicit any type error in upload page

3. **Build Process** ✅
   - Local build works perfectly: `pnpm turbo run build --filter=@voai/frontend`
   - All pages are generated successfully
   - TypeScript checking passes

### Current Issue:

The Vercel project has incorrect settings stored on their servers:
- Root Directory is set to: `apps/frontend` 
- This causes a path duplication issue: `~/voai-website/apps/frontend/apps/frontend`

### Required Manual Fix:

You need to update the project settings in Vercel Dashboard:

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/vi4/voai-website/settings
2. Find "Root Directory" setting
3. Change it from `apps/frontend` to `.` (or leave it empty)
4. Save the changes

### Verified Configuration:

The correct configuration in `vercel.json` is:
```json
{
  "buildCommand": "pnpm turbo run build --filter=@voai/frontend",
  "installCommand": "pnpm install --frozen-lockfile",
  "outputDirectory": "apps/frontend/.next",
  "framework": "nextjs"
}
```

### After Fixing Root Directory:

Run the deployment command:
```bash
vercel --prod
```

Or use the quick deploy script:
```bash
./quick-deploy.sh
```

### Alternative Solution:

If you can't change the project settings, you can create a new Vercel project:
```bash
# Remove local project link
rm -rf .vercel

# Create new project
vercel --prod
# When prompted, create a new project with correct settings
```

## Summary:

All code and build issues have been resolved. The only remaining issue is a Vercel project configuration that needs to be updated via their dashboard. Once the Root Directory setting is corrected, the deployment will succeed.
