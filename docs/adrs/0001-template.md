## ADR Process

### When to Write an ADR

Write an ADR when:
- Making significant architectural decisions
- Choosing between multiple viable options
- Deviating from established patterns
- Adopting new technologies or frameworks
- Making decisions with long-term impact

### ADR Lifecycle

1. **Proposed**: Initial draft, open for discussion
2. **Accepted**: Decision has been made and will be implemented
3. **Deprecated**: No longer relevant but kept for history
4. **Superseded**: Replaced by a newer ADR

### ADR Naming Convention

- Format: `NNNN-title-with-dashes.md`
- NNNN: 4-digit number, incremented
- Title: Brief, descriptive, lowercase, dash-separated

### Review Process

1. Create ADR as "Proposed"
2. Open PR for review
3. Gather feedback from stakeholders
4. Update based on feedback
5. Mark as "Accepted" when consensus reached
6. Merge to main branch

### Good ADR Practices

- **Be concise**: Aim for 1-2 pages
- **Be specific**: Avoid vague language
- **Be honest**: Document real trade-offs
- **Be timely**: Write ADRs when decisions are made
- **Be complete**: Include all relevant information
