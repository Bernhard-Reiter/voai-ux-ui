- ✅ Applied consistent code formatting

## 🔄 Current Status

### CI/CD Pipeline
- ✅ Lint checks passing
- ✅ Type checks passing  
- ✅ Build successful
- ⚠️ Unit tests - checking status
- ⚠️ Integration tests - in progress
- ⚠️ Security scan - needs server running
- ⚠️ Visual regression - pending
- ⚠️ Lighthouse - waiting for build artifact

### Known Issues
1. OWASP ZAP scan fails because it needs Vercel preview URL
2. Some test suites may need environment variables
3. Visual regression tests need baseline images

## 📋 Next Steps

### 1. Supabase Project Configuration
```bash
# In Supabase Dashboard:
1. Enable Google OAuth provider
2. Add redirect URLs:
   - http://localhost:3000/auth/callback
   - https://voai-website-*.vercel.app/auth/callback
3. Run database migrations
4. Configure RLS policies
```

### 2. Fix Remaining CI Issues
- Add missing test environment variables
- Update visual regression baselines
- Configure Lighthouse CI thresholds

### 3. Merge Checklist
- [ ] All CI checks passing
- [ ] Supabase project configured
- [ ] Environment variables set in Vercel
- [ ] Preview deployment tested
- [ ] Auth flows working end-to-end
- [ ] Performance metrics meeting targets

## 📊 Coverage Metrics

Target metrics:
- Unit Test Coverage: ≥85%
- Lighthouse Performance: ≥95
- Security: OWASP ZAP baseline passing
- Load Testing: K6 thresholds met

## 🚀 Deployment Notes

The application now requires:
- Node.js runtime (no longer static export)
- Supabase environment variables
- Server-side rendering support
- Dynamic routing for auth
